SSH into the High Performance Clusters
ssh <OCF_Username>@hpcctl.ocf.berkeley.edu


check out how to submit jobs here: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/hpc/slurm/
Everything below just goes over what is gone over in that link.
Specifically check out how to do it with sbatch! This makes it so that you dont need to
keep your terminal window open the whole time.

submit a job:
sbatch <shell_script>

Inside the shell script, add something like this:
#!/bin/bash <--- this always goes at the top of every bash script
 #SBATCH --ntasks=1 <--- specify OCF compute settings in comments at the top with #SBATCH to start
 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
 #SBATCH --mem=8G
 #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1

 python <python_script.py> <---- this should be the command that runs the python script you wanna run

The output of the slurm job will be put in a file with this name format in the dir you ran sbatch from:
slurm-[your job's numeric ID].out
