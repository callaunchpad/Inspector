SFTP (secure file transport protocol) is a way for us to move local files to
the filesystem of a remote machine. We'll be using this as a way to get large files from
our local system to the remote OCF systems like our datasets. 

You can either use the SFTP command line interface, or download something like Cyberduck
which is much more user friendly. Cyberduck has an actual UI, so it's as if you had 
the finder or file explorer of the remote system opened up. You can then just drag and drop
folders and files from your local system to the remote system, and you can also open up files
in the remote machine with Cyberduck and edit those files.

Cyberduck:
Download cyberduck: https://cyberduck.io/download/
    - click on open connection
    - to access OCF HPCs, enter hpcctl.ocf.berkeley.edu into the server field
    - port number should be 22
    - username is whatever OCF username you registered as
    - same goes for password
    - click on allow for any messages that pop up about fingerprints or keys
    - You can also edit files remotely using an IDE/text editor you've installed locally
        - Open Cyberduck and go to Preferences (after clicking 
          on cyberduck at the top menu for Macs). Then click on editor.
        - While you're at it go to Browser and click on "show hidden files" and "Double click opens 
          file in external editor
 
SFTP Command Line:
A nice tutorial is here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sftp-to-securely-transfer-files-with-a-remote-server
    - type sftp <username>@hpcctl.ocf.berkeley.edu to establish a connection
    - note that once you enter the sftp CLI, not all common commands that you're used to will
       be present. For example mv isn't an actual thing with sftp. It's pretty annoying imo, but
       if you wanna use this method for managing files you can look up all the commands online.
