SSH into the High Performance Clusters
ssh my_ocf_username@hpcctl.ocf.berkeley.edu


check out how to submit jobs here: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/hpc/slurm/
Everything below just goes over what is gone over in that link.
Specifically check out how to do it with sbatch! This makes it so that you dont need to
keep your terminal window open the whole time.

submit a job:
sbatch <shell_script>

Inside the shell script, add a format like this:
#!/bin/bash
 #SBATCH --ntasks=1
 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
 #SBATCH --mem=8G
 #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1

 python <python_script.py>
 echo "Hello world!"

The output of the slurm job will be put in a file with this name format in the dir you ran sbatch from:
slurm-[your job's numeric ID].out
